## GUI Factory
- The GUI Factory is a system that allows clients to create families of related UI components,
  such as buttons and checkboxes, for different platforms (e.g., Windows, Mac, Linux)
- Using the Abstract Factory Design Pattern, we can dynamically switch
  between different themes without modifying the client code.


## Bad Design (Violating Abstract Factory Design Pattern)
- The client directly instantiates concrete classes (WindowsButton, MacButton),
  leading to a tight coupling between the client and the concrete products.
- The UIFactory class contains conditional logic (if-else)
  to decide which product (Windows or Mac button) to create.
  This makes the system inflexible and hard to maintain when adding new platforms (e.g., Linux).


## Good Design (Using Abstract Factory Design Pattern)
- Introduce interfaces (Button, Checkbox) for UI components,
  allowing the client to work with these abstract types
  without knowing the details of their concrete implementations.
- Define an abstract factory interface that declares methods
  for creating related objects (e.g., createButton(), createCheckbox()).
  This ensures that families of related objects are created together.
- For each platform (e.g., WindowsFactory, MacFactory), implement the abstract factory interface
  to create platform-specific components (WindowsButton, MacButton, etc.).
  Each concrete factory knows how to create objects for its specific platform.
- The client (Application) now depends on the abstract factory and product interfaces,
  so it does not know the specifics of which platform it is using.
  This allows the platform (theme) to be selected dynamically at runtime,
  and the client doesn't need to be changed to support new themes.


## How It Works:
- The client requests the creation of a family of objects (button, checkbox) from the abstract factory.
- The appropriate concrete factory (Windows, Mac, etc.) is selected,
  and it creates the corresponding concrete objects.


## When to Use
- When you need to create Factory of Factories
- The system must be independent of how its objects are created, composed, or represented.
- You need to switch product families dynamically at runtime.


## Use Cases
- Cross-platform GUI libraries: A UI library that supports different platforms
  (Windows, Mac, Linux) can use the Abstract Factory pattern
  to provide platform-specific UI components without modifying the client code.
- Theming systems: Applications that allow users to switch between different themes
  (e.g., light theme, dark theme) use Abstract Factory to ensure all components
  (buttons, text fields, checkboxes) are consistent with the selected theme.
