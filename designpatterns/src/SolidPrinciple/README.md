// **** SOLID Principles of OOPS ****

Advantages:
1. Avoid duplicate code
2. Easy to maintain
3. Easy to understand
4. Flexible software
5. Reduce complexity

## Single Responsibility Principle
- A class should have only 1 reason to change

## Open Closed Principle
- Open for Extension but Closed for Modification

## Liskov Substitution Principle
- Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program

## Interface Segregation Principle
- Do not force any client to implement an interface which is irrelevant to them

## Dependency Inversion Principle
- Class should depend on interfaces rather than concrete classes
