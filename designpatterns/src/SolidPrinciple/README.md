## SOLID Principles of OOPS
- Avoid duplicate code
- Easy to maintain
- Easy to understand
- Flexible software
- Reduce complexity

## Single Responsibility Principle
- A class should have only 1 reason to change

## Open Closed Principle
- Open for Extension but Closed for Modification

## Liskov Substitution Principle
- Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program

## Interface Segregation Principle
- Do not force any client to implement an interface which is irrelevant to them
